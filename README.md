# TikTok-Viewbot

https://github.com/zoony1337 - This guy came up with an amazing automator for the a tiktok viewbot.
https://github.com/zoony1337/TikTok-Viewbot/blob/master/main.py - Upon trying it I had a few problems like not being able to visit the site without getting a 502 Error and some other things.
Upon fiddling with user agents, I was able to get the site to work, they now have rebranded to https://ketuy.com/ - The site remains pretty much the same but some of the xpaths needed updating.
Fixing this took a few minutes - All I really did was add a useragent and update the xpaths.

Find your version of chrome - https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-version-of-chrome-do-i-have
Then get the correct version of chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Extract any zips and get the executable.
In the folder you have the python program put the executable of chromedriver in it.

Enjoy! Consider following + starring the post, also do it to zoony as it's a fix of his work after all!

This is a violation of tos so don't use it btw - it's a demo and I don't think it should be used ;)
